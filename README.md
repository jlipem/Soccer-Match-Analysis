# Soccer-Match-Analysis
Collection of algorithms to analyze and make predictions about soccer matches


TODO:

Apriori pattern analysis:
    Create categorical variables out of a team's season. For example: 38 games long for the EPL, with each game being one of:
    ["BW", "SW", "D", "SL", "BL"]
    Implement apriori algorithm

Create a function that generates a row of inputs for a neural network, each row including apriori input, GF in x games, GA in x games, etc.

Train, tune, and test a neural network to make predictions about soccer matches
